<h1>Group Reflection</h1>
<h5>Jordan</h5>
<p>For this assignment, our group was working much better together as we learnt a lot from the previous assignment about how to work in a team, and how our fellow team members prefer to work. Once again, our GitHub trail does not reflect in any way how we worked together as a team as it&rsquo;s only used in our presentation for our group website. This report contains links to our Discord Server and our multiple Google Docs, which is where all of our collaboration happened. We held meetings on Discord two times per week, which was primarily on voice chat, which is not recorded. Instead, the allocated meeting secretary, usually Chris, would take notes during the meeting. This document is also linked in this report. I think everything went very well during this six week assignment period this time around with no real setbacks. I thought is was surprising this time that we received a request for another member to join our group and then suddenly vanish when we lost communication with them. In this assignment, I have furthered by experience in working with groups and have learnt about the importance of setting firm goals and expectations so work can be completed on time.</p>
<br>
<h5>Francis</h5>
<p>As we have already worked as a group on Assignment 2 , The transition to assignment 3 went smoothly , with all the tried and tested tools in place the group reacted more comfortably and with confidence to take on the Assignment . Then the only thing we had to come up with was the Project idea, after listening to everyone&rsquo;s ideas we decided to go with Suki&rsquo;s idea that resonated with all of us as something worth pursuing.</p>
<p>This time all members volunteered for their tasks as per their individual liking and the prefered subject matter relevant to the task.</p>
<p>Only thing I see as lacking in our group would be the fact that everyone seems to try and back off of GitHub and interacting more with Git. As an important tool that could help us all in our future endeavours as programmers and IT professionals I thought that was an area that we should have put a bit more focus on. Apart from that I would say everything else worked out well .</p>
<br>
<h5>Suki</h5>
<p>I feel like compared to the A2 assignment our group communication errors were almost nil, everyone seemed to be much more comfortable with one another so from the very start tasks were self-assigned without any hassle. One of the main criticisms from our tutor was that we didn&rsquo;t keep better track of our work, which I think wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue this time around as we are providing the tutors with much more to work with. As I mentioned in the previous assignment, the fact that there were no misunderstandings between the group members was again very refreshing. I feel like we focused too much of our energy in trying to bring the project to life that we neglected other parts of the assignment until the very last minute, so next time around we should allocate our focus efficiently.</p>
<br>
<h5>Sophie</h5>
<p>For assignment 3, the group worked well and the communication was much better between the group members. The group was conscious that we should have made sure that there was understanding between all group members when deadlines were to be met, as well as when meetings were to be held, as mentioned in the reflections of the members in Assignment 2. This was dealt with and every meeting for Assignment 3 was attended by all members of the group, or tried to make sure that everyone was able to attend the meetings. We made sure that meetings were held at the same time twice every week to make sure that it was easier to remember. Tasks were set at the start of the assignment and responsibility was shared equally amongst all members.</p>
<br>
<h5>Chris</h5>
<p>I feel the group learnt a lot from the last assignment and really came together. We had our tried and tested processes from assignment two which laid a solid platform for us to get to work as soon as possible. Our group attendance at the meetings was great with almost 100% attendance. Our members were much more proactive with tasks this time and took on work to spread the load across the team. An improvement for next time would be completing tasks with enough time to consolidate the report and review it for submission. I found we left tasks to the last week to finalise and it felt rushed in the end. Our time management needs to improve to allow for any last minute issues. One thing I found surprising was the excitement the group showed when Suki came up with our project idea. We all contributed great ideas, however, that idea just clicked with all of us and we spoke about it for hours! I have learnt that group work takes time. Everyone has their own way of doing things and their own life requirements. Due to this, I would try to encourage a more flexible timeline to avoid any last minute rush.</p>
<br>
<h5>Team SWELDD</h5>
<p>In summary, the group felt that we have significantly improved since last time. We were proactive in the tasks that were assigned to us and everyone was present in most of the meetings we had along the way. The group collectively decided to go with the tried and tested tools that we used in Assignment two as we were comfortable using them effectively with the experience gained by using them in the previous assignment.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the individual statements above, as a group we decided to go with Google Docs and Discord for collaboration, communication and record keeping. As a result, our GitHub audit trail may not reflect the work that the group has put in and may reflect that we have not used GitHub effectively. This however is rectified by our chosen tools for collaborating instead of GitHub.</p>
<p>It is the view of some members that we have left some tasks to the last minute and that our task scheduling could have been better. We would be able to improve this by setting more hard and fast goals to be completed within set dates.</p>
<p>The highlight and most important task of this assignment was the project. The group came up with some great ideas in our regular meetings. We discussed these ideas and other task scheduling points at our meetings. After some deliberation we decided to go with &lsquo;Kutulu, The Monster Helper&rsquo; that was suggested by one of our members as highlighted in the individual descriptions above. The group felt that it was current and relevant in today&rsquo;s society because mental health is being more widely understood as a real issue among all generations. And we felt that not every individual would come forward to seek help or talk about it with someone or on an open forum. So, our solution was to get some advice anonymously and at any time when a person needs it, using the most sophisticated electronic communication tools that are now available to us all. We think the best way to achieve this is by introducing artificial intelligence that can communicate effectively about the subject, namely an interactive chatbot that is available at any given time on any device for immediate help.</p>
<p>In realising the enormity of this task, we realised that we will not be able to come up with a working model of an artificially intelligent bot within the few weeks available to us. We have however, made an effort to show how this can be achieved with two prototypes being completed, one in Java and the other in Javascript.</p>
<p>If we were going to take one thing away as a group, it would be to make sure the entire group was aware that their amount of contribution could affect their mark at the completion of our course. The contributions form was misunderstood by some, as a result some members did not contribute as much as others and this was highlighted in the form. This caused some difficult conversations to take place in the final stages of our assignment. By this stage it was too late and the outcome was that some members were dissatisfied in how much they contributed along the way.</p>
<p>In closing, we learnt a massive amount while conducting this course and while learning to work in groups. We all enjoyed each of the team members input and formed some great bonds along the way.</p>
<p>This was a very positive experience.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoyed our project as much as we enjoyed creating it.</p>
<p>Sweldd.</p>
