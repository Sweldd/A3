<h1>Team Profile</h1>

<h2>Team Name - SWELDD</h2>
<p>This team name was chosen at the beginning of assignment 2. It is the first letter of the groups last names combined into a strong sounding word. Unfortunately a group member &lsquo;L&rsquo; left the group early on. We decided as a group to keep the name.</p>
<h2>Personal information</h2>
<p>Jordan Draganoff</p>
<p>Student Number: S3818714</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Jordan. I was born in the late 1990&rsquo;s and grew up in the large country town of Bundaberg, Queensland. I enjoy an active lifestyle and love to travel, hike and go jet-skiing. I graduated high school in 2013 and have been working in my parent&rsquo;s business in the areas of sales, marketing and web development to name a few. In 2018, I decided to pursue my dream and started on my journey to become an IT professional.</p>
<p>Francis Dharmasiri</p>
<p>Student Number: S9356452</p>
<p>My name is Francis Dharmasiri a Sri Lankan born Australian. I migrated to Australia in 1990 and lived in Melbourne from then to 2010. now I live in Bunbury, WA. I have 3 children and I am a proud grandpa of 6 grandchildren all of whom live in Melbourne.</p>
<p>I started my work in Australia in the hospitality industry and eventually in year 2000 started a company in facilities management that I am managing to date.</p>
<p>My hobbies are mainly reading, and my favourite topic is Philosophy, but I like keeping in touch with all the developments in the field of computing, including software and hardware. I have been interested in the field from the time BASIC (Beginners All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) language came out in the 80&rsquo;s. I am glad that now I have some time to pursue that interest in IT and do this degree in IT for my personal satisfaction and If possible to do some contract work in the field of systems security and penetration testing.</p>
<p>Susika &lsquo;Suki&rsquo; Sumanasuriya</p>
<p>Student Number: S3620271</p>
<p>My name is Susika &lsquo;Suki&rsquo; Sumanasuriya. I was born in Sri lanka but migrated to Australia when I was 12. I am bilingual and can speak 2 languages (english &amp; sinhala). My favourite pastime includes watching tv shows &amp; movies. My interest in IT has been a lifelong obsession ever since I was a kid, I always had a particular interest in technology over other things. I currently have no actual experience in IT apart from the IT electives i took during my grade school years. I am very happy to be part of the SWELD group, and hope to do the very best.</p>
<p>Sophie&nbsp;Walker</p>
<p>Student number: S3802023</p>
<p>Hey, I'm Sophie! I've lived on each side of this wonderful country that we call Australia, but currently call Sydney home. I graduated from high school in 2016 and have been enjoying my time since binge watching Netflix and trying nearly every snack that my local servo has to offer! I Suppose that my interest in IT was influenced from an early age, with my father</p>
<p>working in the Royal Australian Navy and then in the mining industry in Western Australia. I was always interested in how things work and what new technologies were being brought out to help with whatever he was doing. After he left the mining industry, I was lucky enough that he let me see some of what he was doing, by this time it was in robotics and I loved it. At the moment I have little to no IT experience (apart from the small amount of high school coding that I did), but I am excited to see everything to know and learn.</p>
<p>Chris Evans</p>
<p>Student Number: S3813726</p>
<p>My name is Chris Evans, I live in Newcastle NSW with my beautiful wife (Caroline), a ten-month-old son (Austin) who keeps us very busy and a dog (Leo). My hobbies include baseball, golf, amateur home brewing, gardening, fishing and camping. As a kid that grew up in the era where IT boomed, I was always fascinated with technology. My interests were expanded during high school studies where I then pursued an IT career in the Australian Air Force. For 13 years I have been progressing through the organisation and undertaking various roles along the way from a hands-on technician to a technical workforce manager. I am hoping to find a way to combine my interest of IT into my aspirations of environmental change. This could be through green energy technology advancements, sustainability with automation or networking household energy storage; Hoping to find my calling.</p>
