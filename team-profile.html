<h1>Team Profile</h1>

<h2>Team Name - SWELDD</h2>
<p>This team name was chosen at the beginning of assignment 2. It is the first letter of the groups last names combined into a strong sounding word. Unfortunately a group member &lsquo;L&rsquo; left the group early on. We decided as a group to keep the name.</p>
<h2>Personal information</h2>

<p><h5>Francis Dharmasiri</h5></p>
<img class="profile-image" src="images/francis/Me.jpg"></div>
<p>Student Number: S9356452</p>
<p>My name is Francis Dharmasiri a Sri Lankan born Australian. I migrated to Australia in 1990 and lived in Melbourne from then to 2010. now I live in Bunbury, WA. I have 3 children and I am a proud grandpa of 6 grandchildren all of whom live in Melbourne.</p>
<p>I started my work in Australia in the hospitality industry and eventually in year 2000 started a company in facilities management that I am managing to date.</p>
<p>My hobbies are mainly reading, and my favourite topic is Philosophy, but I like keeping in touch with all the developments in the field of computing, including software and hardware. I have been interested in the field from the time BASIC (Beginners All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) language came out in the 80&rsquo;s. I am glad that now I have some time to pursue that interest in IT and do this degree in IT for my personal satisfaction and If possible to do some contract work in the field of systems security and penetration testing.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Jordan. I was born in the late 1990&rsquo;s and grew up in the large country town of Bundaberg, Queensland. I enjoy an active lifestyle and love to travel, hike and go jet-skiing. I graduated high school in 2013 and have been working in my parent&rsquo;s business in the areas of sales, marketing and web development to name a few. In 2018, I decided to pursue my dream and started on my journey to become an IT professional.</p>

<p><h5>Chris Evans</h5></p>
<img class="profile-image" src="images/chris-web.jpg"></div>
<p>Student Number: S3813726</p>
<p>My name is Chris Evans, I live in Newcastle NSW with my beautiful wife (Caroline), a ten-month-old son (Austin) who keeps us very busy and a dog (Leo). My hobbies include baseball, golf, amateur home brewing, gardening, fishing and camping. As a kid that grew up in the era where IT boomed, I was always fascinated with technology. My interests were expanded during high school studies where I then pursued an IT career in the Australian Air Force. For 13 years I have been progressing through the organisation and undertaking various roles along the way from a hands-on technician to a technical workforce manager. I am hoping to find a way to combine my interest of IT into my aspirations of environmental change. This could be through green energy technology advancements, sustainability with automation or networking household energy storage; Hoping to find my calling.</p>

<p>Student Number: S3620271</p>
<p>My name is Susika &lsquo;Suki&rsquo; Sumanasuriya. I was born in Sri lanka but migrated to Australia when I was 12. I am bilingual and can speak 2 languages (english &amp; sinhala). My favourite pastime includes watching tv shows &amp; movies. My interest in IT has been a lifelong obsession ever since I was a kid, I always had a particular interest in technology over other things. I currently have no actual experience in IT apart from the IT electives i took during my grade school years. I am very happy to be part of the SWELD group, and hope to do the very best.</p>

<p><h5>Sophie&nbsp;Walker</h5></p>
<img class="profile-image" src="images/sophie.jpg"> </div>
<p>Student number: S3802023</p>
<p>Hey, I'm Sophie! I've lived on each side of this wonderful country that we call Australia, but currently call Sydney home. I graduated from high school in 2016 and have been enjoying my time since binge watching Netflix and trying nearly every snack that my local servo has to offer! I Suppose that my interest in IT was influenced from an early age, with my father</p>
<p>working in the Royal Australian Navy and then in the mining industry in Western Australia. I was always interested in how things work and what new technologies were being brought out to help with whatever he was doing. After he left the mining industry, I was lucky enough that he let me see some of what he was doing, by this time it was in robotics and I loved it. At the moment I have little to no IT experience (apart from the small amount of high school coding that I did), but I am excited to see everything to know and learn.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Group Processes</h2>
<p>The group worked together well in Assignment 2. There were some good and bad points as we were just starting to learn how to work in teams.</p>
<p>Some of the good things the group undertook were, the use of collaboration tools (such as Discord, google docs and GitHub), kept a timeline document, tracked all meetings with a meeting agenda and made our intentions clear with a group charter.</p>
<p>Some of the not so good experiences were, poor team meeting organisation, poor communication and understanding of the assignment specifications, typical communication errors within the group using voice chat, delayed initial planning of the assignment and issues not meeting the timeline goals set by the group.</p>
<p>All of these issues have been addressed for the remainder of the course with our group. Our team set to work immediately and had tried and tested foundations to work with. We discussed the areas that needed improvement prior to commencing and all members agreed to improving them. The group has really improved as a result and we are finding the assignment was conducted in a more efficient manner.</p>
<p>All team members were happy with the communication on Discord and using google docs in canvas. This was after a relatively slow start where we did not communicate as effectively as we could have from the beginning. There was definitely room for improvement! We scored average marks for assignment 2 and the team are determined this time to make amends and pull off a solid mark. We will be changing some of our techniques (ie inserting a table of contents into our report and capturing all of our artefacts) and processes (Ensuring we go through our report prior to final submission and productively scrutinise and identify any areas we may be lacking in). We also identified that our GitHub usage was not as detailed as what it should have been. This time around we plan on either using GitHib or elaborating&nbsp;on what we did use instead and why.</p>
<p>We have already started off in a better way! Our communication from the start of assignment 3 was very good. We have tracked every meeting with written agendas, created an artefacts page to capture all of the interesting things we have investigated or used along the way, utilised another group charter as a sign of good faith to the team and created another timeline that we plan on being a massive help in our planning and goal setting throughout the assignment.</p>

<h2>Career Plans</h2>
<br>
<p>Our groups ideal Jobs</p>
<ul>
<li>Jordan - Business Analyst</li>
<li>Francis - Systems Security Analyst</li>
<li>Suki - Research Scientist in Machine Learning</li>
<li>Sophie - Data Analyst</li>
<li>Chris - Project Developer</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>As the IT Industry is so varied, it certainly makes sense that each member in our group has chosen a different ideal job to discuss. Members of our group have chosen jobs in the field of analysts, researchers and developers.</p>
<p>Three members of the group have chosen analyst jobs including Business Analyst, Systems Security Analyst and Data Analyst. Even though these three jobs share part of the same name and are positions commonly found in businesses, they are vastly different and require uniquely different skill sets. For example a business analyst would typically work in a business management team and help make important decisions about business IT operations and software, while a data analyst may share the same office, they would be involved in projects where large amounts of data are being collected, processed and implemented into different projects. The third analyst job, systems security analyst, would require yet another unique skill set to be successful.</p>
<p>People involved in industries such as machine learning and green energy certainly have the power to change the world and make it a better place for everyone. It can be easily seen that jobs in the clean energy sector are likely to increase as society progresses to be more environmentally friendly. If this happens, many more jobs will become available including project developer and management jobs. As the clean energy sector if often involved with cutting edge technology, it makes perfect sense to have a good understanding of IT or even better, hold a degree. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence seems to be dominating the cutting edge of Information Technology at the moment. This is no surprise as the potential for this technology is enormous! But with this technology comes great responsibility and the need for knowledge and regulation at an early stage to prevent any catastrophe. This is why researchers and scientists in this field will have such an important job now and in the future.</p>
<p>It can clearly be seen that the IT industry will continue to dominate now and in the future in terms of business and improving the world that we live in.</p>
